          <h2>What are preselling condos?</h2>
          <p>
            Preselling condominiums are residential properties that developers
            offer for sale while the project is still in the building stage.
            This gives prospective purchasers the opportunity to reserve a unit
            ahead of schedule and benefit from early purchase incentives.

        <div class="faq">
          <h2>Is it true that a condominium's lifespan is set at 50 years?</h2>
          <p>
            No, it's important to remember that you are joining a corporation
            when you buy a condominium unit. For this reason, property
            management or building administrators are employed in every
            condominium building. The condominium doesn't last forever, but the
            corporation in charge of it does. Normally, corporations last for 50
            years, although they can be extended for another period of time.

          <h2>Do I have to apply for a bank loan upon reserving the unit?</h2>
          <p>
            No, Megaworld gives you a number of payment choices that let you
            spread out the contract price over a predetermined number of years,
            with about 30â€“35% of the total cost. You will be able to apply for a
            house loan after your condo is finished. In order to provide you
            enough time to prepare your house loan application, Megaworld will
            contact you many months in advance of the turnover date, ensuring
            prompt communication.

          <h2>Can foreigners buy a condominium unit?</h2>
          <p>
            In fact, foreigners are allowed to own all of the condominium
            condominiums in the Philippines, provided that Filipino nationals
            own at least 60% of the building overall. This clause permits a
            harmonious balance between domestic and foreign investments by
            guaranteeing adherence to the laws governing foreign ownership in
            the real estate industry.

            price. However, it is important to note that upon property turnover,
            there are additional government taxes and move-in fees to be
            settled. These fees encompass the following components:

          <br />
