              The Philippines' first-ever underground mass transport system. The
              Metro Manila Subway is a 36-kilometer rail line that is an
              infrastructure project aimed at reducing travel time between
              Quezon City and the Ninoy Aquino International Airport to just 30
              minutes with 17 stations across Metro Manila's municipalities.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              According to the Department of Transportation, the project's
              overall completion is at 25.09% and is expected to be fully
              operational by the third quarter of 2027.

            <div class="title">Megaworld Corporation</div>
            <p class="text">
              Megaworld Corporation, established by Dr. Andrew Tan on August 24,
              1989, under Philippine law, is a prominent figure in the real
              estate sector, known for its development, leasing, and marketing
              prowess. Initially renowned for its construction of high-end
              residential condominiums and commercial properties in strategic
              urban locales across Metro Manila, Megaworld pivoted towards
              mixed-use community development in 1996. This transition,
              exemplified by projects like Eastwood City, catered to the
              burgeoning demand for integrated living, working, and leisure
              spaces, particularly targeting the middle-income demographic.
              Alongside its primary focus on real estate development, Megaworld
              also engages in ancillary activities such as project design,
              construction supervision, and property management, ensuring
              comprehensive service delivery.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              A significant milestone in its corporate evolution occurred on
              August 19, 1999, when Megaworld rebranded to reflect its
              transformation into a holding company, while maintaining its
              commitment to real estate excellence. Over the past 33 years,
              Megaworld has solidified its position as the foremost developer of
              residential and office spaces in the Philippines, outpacing
              competitors and adapting to changing market dynamics. Dr. Andrew
              L. Tan, the visionary founder and Chairman, pioneered the
              Live-Work-Play-Learn township concept, integrating residential
              buildings, office towers, commercial hubs, and luxury
              accommodations within vibrant communities. This innovative
              approach not only sets Megaworld apart but also underscores its
              dedication to creating holistic urban environments that cater to
              diverse lifestyle needs.
